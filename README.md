# ECE 461/561 - Mini Project \#1
## Two-Transmission-Link Queueing System Simulator and Output
This is a project to simulate a two link M/M/1/k queueing system in various configuration formats. It ouputs various metrics and graphs to help visualize differences in configurations.
***
## Installation
Must have Python3 installed along with the SciPy stack found [here](https://www.scipy.org/install.html#installing-via-pip). If those are installed clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/dlubawy/Queueing-Simulation.git <install directory>`. Replace `<install directory>` with where you want the project.
***
## Usage
Change directory to where you downloaded the files. Start a Jupyter notebook with the command `jupyter notebook`. This will start a webserver at `localhost:8888`, connect and login following the instructions given. The files should show up in your notebook, if not you can just uploag them using the interface. To run the simulation just go to the `Queueing\ Simulation.ipynb` file and run the kernel.
